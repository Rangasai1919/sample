<h2>Early Life And Education </h2><hr>

Rajinikanth was born as Shivaji Rao Gaikwad on 12 December 1950 in a Marathi Hindu family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present day Karnataka).[27][1][28] His mother was a homemaker,[e] and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad was a police constable.[1] His ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Pune district, Maharashtra.[30][31] He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai).[32][27] After his father's retirement from work in 1956, the family moved to the suburb of Hanumantha Nagar in Bangalore and built a house there.[27] He lost his mother at the age of nine.[33]

Rajinikanth had his primary education at the Gavipuram Government Kannada Model Primary School in Bangalore.[34] As a child, he was <mark>"studious and mischievous" with a great interest in cricket, football and basketball.</mark> During this time, his brother enrolled him at the Ramakrishna Math, a Hindu monastery set up by the Ramakrishna Mission.Upon completion of his school education, Rajinikanth performed several jobs including that of a coolie,[36] before getting a job in the Bangalore Transport Service as a bus conductor.[37][38] He continued to take part in plays after the Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of his mythological plays. He decided to take up an acting course in the newly formed<u> Madras Film Institute after coming across an advertisement</u>.[39]

<h2>present: Career fluctuations and return to success</h2><hr>
<mark> January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana,</mark> a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time.[81]<mark> During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, </mark>he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion.[132] He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged.[133] Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever.[134] <u>He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit.</u>[135] Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating.[136] Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems.[137] The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment.[136] It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush.[138]

On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs-up, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports.[139] The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors.[140] Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation.[141] <mark>After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth,</mark> under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital.[142][143] After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.[144][145] Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor.[146] In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project, titled Kochadaiiyaan.[147] The film became a huge disaster at the box office.[148]
